NexTier OFS  <br>
3990 Rogerdale Rd, Houston, TX 77042  <br>
Midland, TX  <br> 
11/2022 - Present  <br>

In my current role at NexTier’s Special Projects department, I am charged with developing solutions to increase 
efficiency and support the frac and field IT operations across the company. My responsibilities include field support, 
PC and laptop management and imaging, software and hardware testing, creating and implementing various automation tools, 
and utilizing Microsoft Power Apps to create new ways for my internal team and teams across my organization to manage logistics, management, and testing.  <br>

This expertise is particularly relevant for monitoring and analyzing network
traffic, application logs, and other network and security relevant data to identify potential problems, threats, and vulnerabilities.
I actively analyze operational issues and implement streamlined methods to optimize Configuration
Management/Release Management processes.

My involvement in information security programs underscores my commitment to maintaining stringent security
measures. This background positions me to effectively advise managers and systems teams on information
security issues and policy. Additionally, my experience in developing integrated solutions and conducting
thorough testing is directly applicable to analyzing system compliance against DoD standards, such as DISA's
Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG).

Furthermore, my role in providing remote support for end users faced with various hardware, software,
configuration, and connectivity issues has honed my communications and critical thinking skillsets. This ability to effectively communicate
complex technical information is crucial for non-technically inclined users as well as internal stakeholders and external
partners to ensure proper guidance, reporting, and due diligence in accordance with SLAs and governmental regulations.

Overall, my track record in developing integrated solutions, conducting thorough testing, enhancing and providing user
support, optimizing processes, and upholding information security standards showcases my commitment to the mission of the company as well as my own personal standards of 
taking pride in what I do while being able to own mistakes.
